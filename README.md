## chapter 01 - Inception

## chapter 02 - Igniting Our App

### parcelüì¶

    - Dev Build
    - Local Server
    - HMP = Hot Module Replacement
    - File Watching Algorithm - written in c++
    - Caching - Faster Builds
    - Image Optimization
    - Minification
    - Bundling
    - Compress
    - Consistent Hashing
    - Code Splitting
    - Differential Bundling - support older browsers
    - Diagnostic
    - Error Handling
    - HTTPs
    - Tree Shaking - remove unused code
    - Different Dev and Production bundles

### `npx parcel index.html`

    To run a project

## chapter 03 - Laying the foundation

To run or build a project find scripts in package.json

```
"scripts": {
"start": "parcel index.html",
"build": "parcel build index.html",
"test": "jest"
},
```

### `npm run start | npm start`

    Runs the app in the development mode

### `npm run build`

    Builds the app for production

### JSX React

- JSX is not HTML inside JavaScript
- HTML-like or XML-like syntax

### Babel

- JavaScript transpiler
- Convert JSX to React code

  ```
  React.createElement => Object => HTMLElement(render)

  JSX (transpiled before it reaches the JS Engine) => PARCEL => Babel

  JSX =>Babel transpiles it to React.createE lement => ReactElement (JS Object) => HTMLElement (render)
  ```

### React Component

- Everything is component in react
- Class Based Component - OLD
- Functional Component - NEW (function which returns some piece of JSX code)
- Component Composition - passing components to other components

### React Fragment

```
<React.Fragment></React.Fragment> | <></>

```

## chapter 04 - Talk is cheap, show me the code

### üçúfood ordering app

`Component`

- Headder
  - Logo
  - Nav items
- Body
  - Search
  - RestaurantContainer
    - Restaurant card
      - Image
      - Star rating
      - Cuisine
      - Delivery time
- Footer

  - Copyright
  - Links
  - Address
  - Contact

  ```
  Inline styling

      style={{backgroundColor: "#f0f0f0"}}
  ```

### Props

- a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component in React
- normal arguments to a function

### Config Driven UI

- Instead of writing fixed code for each UI element, the UI is defined and controlled by data

### Reusable component

- component that can be used multiple times throughout an application with different data or configurations.

### Why we need key

- Each component needs its own special ID that makes it stand out and be recognized as unique.
- If a unique key is not provided to components in React, they may be re-rendered unnecessarily.
- It is not recommended to use indexes as keys in React components

  ```
    !Key (!Acceptable) <<<< Index as key <<<< Unique id
  ```

## chapter 05 - Let's get hooked

### Two types of Export/Import

- Default Export/Import
  export default Component
  import Component from "path"

- Named Export/Import
  export const Component
  import {Component} from "path"

### React Hooks (useState)

- Normal JavaScript utility functions
- useState() - Superpowerful state variable in react (sync UI)

  ```
    import { useState } from "react";
    const [state, setState] = useState("set initial value")

  ```

### React

- It makes developer experience easy
- Write less code do more
- Find out the diffrence between two Virtual Dom and update the UI
- It has Diff algorithm
- React Fibre is a new Reconcialiation process to efficiently manipulate the DOM (Virtual Dom)

React uses `Reconcialiation Algorithm` (React Fibre)
React create Virtual Dom

- not an actual dom but a representation of actual dom
- React.createElement => Object

## chapter 06 - Exploring the world

- Making an API call
- Optional Chaining (Handling data)
- Shimmer UI (For UX)
- Conditional Rendering
- Events (onClick, onChange)

### React Hooks (useEffect)

useEffect is used to handle side effects like fetching data or subscribing to events.

- makes an API call after the render is done
- fetch (super power which JS engine has)

  ```
    import { useEffect } from "react";
    useEffect(()=>{
      console.log("useEffect Called")
    },[dependencies])

  ```

### cors policy

When your browser blocks you from calling an API from one origin to a different origin

```
  useState() is a special React variable,

  Whenever a state variable updates React (Triggers a Reconciliation cycle) Re-render the componet

```

## chapter 07 - Finding the path

### useEffect hook

    If no dependency array is passed to `useEffect`, the effect will be called on every render of the component.

    If dependency array is empty `[]` then the useEffect will be called on initial render(just once)

    If you pass a value in the dependency array of `useEffect`, the effect will be called every time that value changes

### useState hook

    Never create `useState` hook outside of your React component

    Used to create `local state variable` in the `function components`

    the `useState` hook should be called at the top level of your functional component

    Don't create `useState` hook inside an `if-statement`

### react-router-dom library

- Routing configuration (createBrowserRouter)
- Provide router (RouterProvider)
- gives us an access to useRouterError
- Outlet (This allows nested UI to show up when child routes are rendered.)
- Link (Navigate to different route)

  ```
    import { createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider, useRouteError, Outlet, Link } from "react-router-dom";
  ```

### SINGLE PAGE APPLICATION (SPA)

- Changing the component
- Not reoading the page

### Two types of routing in web apps

- Client Side Routing
- Server Side Routing - making network calls

## chapter 08 - Let's get Classy

- Class based component (old way)

  - Normal JS class
  - extends makes react know this is the class component
  - React.Component is a class given by React
  - render() method return some piece of `jsx`
  - The Constructor is a special function that receives the props

  - super()

    - It is used to call the constructor of its parent class.
    - This is required when we need to access some variables of its parent class.

  - Props

    - properties
    - Used for passing data from one component to another
    - Props data is read-only, which means that data coming from the parent should not be changed by child components.

  - this.props

    - If we want to use `this.props` inside the constructor we need to pass it with the `super()` function.

  - when an instance of a class is created, the constructor is called.

  - state variables

    - Create inside `Constructor`
    - update state varibale

      - this.setState({
        count: this.state.count + 1,
        });

    - Never update state variables directly
      - this.state.count = this.state.count + 1

  - Life cycle method

    - Mounting/Loading the component

      - start loading class component
      - new instance of a class is created

        1. first the constructor is called
        2. the render method is called

    - componentDidMount()

      - Called once the component has beed mounted
      - Used to make an API call
      - Quickly render component then make and an Api call

```
  class UserClass extends React.Component {

        constructor(props) {
          super(props);
          console.log(props);

          this.state = {
          count: 0,
          count2: 1,
          };

        }

        render() {
          return (<div className="user__card">
            <h1>Count: {this.state.count}</h1> //state variable
            <p>{this.props.name}</p>
          </div>);
        }
      }

  export default UserClass
```

1. Mounting (dummy data)
   Mounted in 2 phases

   - Render Phase

     - constructor (dummy data)
     - Render (dummy data)

   - Commit Phase

     - Update the DOM - <HTML Dummy>
     - componentDidMount() - make an api call
     - <this.setState> - state variable is update

2. Updating

   - Render (Api Data)
   - <HTML> (new Api Data)
   - call componentDidUpdate()

3. Unmounting

   - componentWillUnmount()
   - removing from the UI

```
    Parent Component

      Parent Constructore
      Parent render

        Child Component (Multiple children)

          First Child Constructore
          First Child render

          Second Child Constructore
          Second Child render

         // DOM UPDATED - IN SINGLE BATCH

          First child component Did Mount
          Second child component Did Mount

    Parent component Did Mount

```
